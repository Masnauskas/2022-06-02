            A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid of
            plasma held together by its gravity. The nearest star to Earth is
            the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but
            their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points
            of light. The most prominent stars have been categorised into
            constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have
            proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that
            identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar
            designations. The observable universe contains an estimated 1022 to
            1024 stars. Still, most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth,
            including all individual stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.

            A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous
            nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium
            and trace amounts of heavier elements. Its total mass is the main
            factor determining its evolution and eventual fate. A star shines
            for most of its active life due to the thermonuclear fusion of
            hydrogen into helium in its core. This process releases energy that
            traverses the star's interior and radiates into outer space. At the
            end of a star's lifetime, its core becomes a stellar remnant: a
            white dwarf, a neutron star, or—if it is sufficiently massive—a
            black hole.

            Stellar nucleosynthesis in stars or their remnants creates almost
            all naturally occurring chemical elements heavier than lithium.
            Stellar mass loss or supernova explosions return chemically enriched
            material to the interstellar medium. They are then recycled into new
            stars. Astronomers can determine stellar properties—including mass,
            age, metallicity (chemical composition), variability, distance, and
            motion through space—by carrying out observations of a star's
            apparent brightness, spectrum, and changes in its position in the
            sky over time.

            Stars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects, as
            in the case of planetary systems and star systems with two or more
            stars. When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their
            gravitational interaction can significantly impact their evolution.
            Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound
            structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.
